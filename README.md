This is the app I'm creating with the hopes of bankrupting Pivotal Labs by stealing market share away from their [Pivotal Tracker](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) app.

No, not really though. This is actually just me working through the examples in the [Rails 3 In Action](http://www.manning.com/katz/) book by [Ryan Bigg (aka Radar)'s](http://github.com/radar) and [Yehuda Katz](http://github.com/wycats).

I figured I might as well [write some documentation](http://zachholman.com/talk/a-documentation-talk) even if this is all just for flexing the rails muscles. Especially if I'm going to be taking all of this creative liberty, like implementing the views in [Haml](http://haml-lang.com/) and [pulling the training wheels off](http://agile-itspeople.blogspot.com/2011/10/when-cucumber-is-mightier-than-pen.html) of [Cucumber](http://aslakhellesoy.com/post/11055981222/the-training-wheels-came-off).
